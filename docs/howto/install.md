# Install Pelf

This has not been published for inclusion in the list of extensions you
can install from within CiviCRM, so you're going to need to do it
manually.

## Prerequisites

* CiviCRM 5.36+

* CiviCase component enabled.

* PHP 7.3+

## Installation from zipped release file

Visit <https://github.com/artfulrobot/pelf/releases> to see the latest
release, and download the .zip (or .tar.gz) file from there.

Unzip that into your extensions directory. Once it's there you should be
able to install from the admin interface, after clicking the Refresh
button on the extensions page.


## Installation from cloned Git repository (developers)

Clone https://github.com/artfulrobot/pelf into your extensions dir. Then
install via the UI, or use `cv en pelf`.
