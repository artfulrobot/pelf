# Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through setting up Pelf to monitor grants that
your organisation applies for.

## Install and configure

First, [install Pelf](/howto/install.md) in the normal way.

Next visit the setup page at **Administer » CiviCase » Setup Pelf**.

Pelf works with the CiviCase component of CiviCRM so before we can do anything
useful we need a suitable Case Type. You can have as many of these as you like
and use them for different types of pipeline processes, e.g. applying to
a grant-giving trust or foundation might typically have a different process to
seeking partnership funding.

This tutorial is focussed on Grant funding applications using a template
provided with Pelf itself. You don't have to use these templates, and you can
change things later to suit your needs, but it saves a lot of clicking to use
a template, so we'll do that now.

Scroll down the page to Templates and find the section called "Case Type: Grant
application".

This shows you the statuses (think of case statuses as stages along your
pipeline) that it suggests. Simply click the **Create this case type** to set
it up.

    Great, we're done with the setup.
